Wow... Loved this place
Crust is not good
Not tasty and the texture was just nasty
Stopped by during the late May bank holiday off Rick Steve recommendation and loved it
The selection on the menu was great and so were the prices
Now I am getting angry and I want my damn pho.
Honeslty it didn't taste THAT fresh
The potatoes were like rubber and you could tell they had been made up ahead of time being kept under a warmer
The fries were great too
A great touch
